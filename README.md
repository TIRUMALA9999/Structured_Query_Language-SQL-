## 📌 Overview

This repository contains **structured SQL learning artifacts** designed to build a **strong foundation in relational databases and query design**.

The repository includes:
- A **comprehensive SQL theory & syntax PDF**
- Practical SQL scripts demonstrating **core query patterns**

These materials form the **database foundation layer** for my work in **Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Analytics systems**.

## 🔄 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

SQL is a **core dependency** for:
- Data analysis and reporting
- Feature engineering for ML
- Data engineering pipelines
- Backend services and APIs

This repository ensures I can:
- Write **efficient and readable SQL**
- Explain query logic clearly
- Optimize queries for real datasets

---

## ⚙️ How to Run SQL Scripts

You can execute `introduction.sql` using:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Any SQL-compatible database client

Example (SQLite):
```bash
sqlite3 sample.db < introduction.sql
```

---

## 🧾 Points 

- Developed strong **SQL foundations** covering data retrieval, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and relational database design concepts.  
- Wrote and analyzed **complex SQL queries** for data extraction, reporting, and analytical use cases.  
- Applied SQL concepts such as **GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOIN strategies** to solve real-world data problems.  
- Built database querying expertise as a foundation for **data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning workflows**.  

---

## 🧠 I Points

- “SQL is my primary tool for structured data exploration.”
- “I can explain joins, subqueries, and aggregation logic clearly.”
- “I use SQL extensively for feature engineering and analytics.”
